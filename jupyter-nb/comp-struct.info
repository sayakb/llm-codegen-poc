Each component must have 5 files:
1. <name>.component.ts - containing the primary component code,
2. <name>.config.ts - containing the config data,
3. <name>.component.html - containing the HTML markup,
4. <name>.component.css - stylesheets,
5. <name>.component.spec.ts - unit tests.

Analyze the files within the subfolders: hello-world, home, spl-button
And use them as examples on how each file is referenced from another.
